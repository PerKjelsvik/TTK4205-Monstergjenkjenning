# [TTK4205 - Pattern Recognition](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TTK4205/2017)

## Course Content

Bayesian decision theory, supervised learning, parametric and non-parametric methods, linear discriminant functions, 
feature extraction, unsupervised learning, cluster analysis, syntactic methods.

In this course, we had a term project, where the projects were done individually. The full project description can be read in 
[the project description pdf](https://github.com/PerKjelsvik/TTK4205-Monstergjenkjenning/blob/master/Oppgavebeskrivelse.pdf),
and my report can be read in [the report pdf](https://github.com/PerKjelsvik/TTK4205-Monstergjenkjenning/blob/master/Rapport.pdf). 
Here is short breakdown of the project:

## Pattern Recognition Project
The project is about finding the best property combination for a given dataset, constructing different classificators, 
as well as evaluating the results. For simplicity, only problems with two classes were considered, but the classificators to be 
used should also be possible to use in multiple-class cases. In practice, you were required to create code that reads data, splits 
the dataset in a training set and a testing set, trains a clssificator of desired type for given property combination, tests this 
classifcator by classifying the objects in the test set and estimates error rates. In addition a short report where you also 
provide a ranking of property combinations and a ranking of the classificators for the best property combinations. In both cases, 
the estimated error rates should also be provided.
